# Background:
Movie Magic aims to revolutionise the cinema by introducing a comprehensive system that caters to both customers and staff. With three luxury cinemas boasting 48 seats each and one widescreen cinema with 300 seats, the project addresses the need for a seamless and efficient cinema operation.
Problem faced:
The existing cinema operations lack a centralised system, causing inefficiencies in seat selection, ticket pricing, and promotional management. Without a dedicated interface, staff struggles to handle operations effectively, and customers face challenges in booking, promotions, and account management.

# Project Goals:
1. Customer Centric Features: Develop a user-friendly system allowing customers to easily select seats, view varied ticket prices based on age groups, and benefit from promotions and discounts.
2. Efficient Cinema Operations: Provide a management interface for staff, enabling streamlined access to movie schedules, seat availability, and customer check-ins.
3. Pricing and Promotions: Implement a flexible pricing structure for different age groups and support regular promotional days. Incorporate features for discount codes, gift cards, and automatic calculations of discounts at the checkout page.
4. Innovative User Experience: Introduce unique features to enhance to overall cinema experience, including movie posters, ratings, and an informative “About Us” section.
5. Booking Functionality: Allow customers to seamlessly view movie details, select seats, and complete bookings. Provide a search box to enhance user experience and simplify movie searches.
6. Customer Account Management: Enable customers to manage profiles, bookings details and gift card balances through a secure login system.
7. Staff and Manager Controls: Grant staff access to their profiles, movie schedules, and customer check-ins. Equip managers with additional capabilities to oversee staff profiles, movie schedules, promotions, and ticket pricing.
8. Admin Controls: Empower system administrators to manage all functions and settings within the system.
